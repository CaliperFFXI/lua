All of my job and gear files are built around the "Kinematics" framework. (thank you Motenten, wherever you are)
### Kinematics Wiki: https://github.com/Kinematics/GearSwap-Jobs/wiki

### You must rename "Caliper-Globals.lua" to match your characters name.

**Mote-Mappings.lua** and **Mote-Utility.lua** must also be replaced in order to get full functionality. 
The original libs files are located in the gearswap\libs folder.
The libs files will very likely see regular updates, so it may be best to regularly check for updates.
